# About

This is an unoffical fork of PHPVirtualBox. The original developer, Ian Moore, started this project on SourceForge https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/ The last offical version of PHPVirtualBox supported VirtualBox 5.0. Since that time VirtualBox 5.1 has been released and various members of the community have tried submitting patches to include support for VirtualBox 5.1. So far none of the patches have been accepted.

We appreciate Ian's hard work over the years and hope he will someday resume work on PHPVirtualBox. In the meantime this repo serves as an unoffical repo where developers can submit patches to have them included until Ian resumes work on the project.
